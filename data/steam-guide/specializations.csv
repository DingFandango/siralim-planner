name,abbreviation,description
Hell Knight, HK,"Careful planning and uptight caution are nothing but a cause to doubt oneself. Hell Knights realize this fact, and instead opt to send their creatures charging headlong into battle, relying on brute strength and reckless attacks to ensure a swift victory.\nAs a Hell Knight, you'll favor creatures that specialize in attacking. Hell Knights grant their creatures increased critical damage and cause a variety of effects to occur when they attack. Hell Knights are surprisingly adept at spellcasting in a pinch, as well."
Reaver, RE,"Perseverance, an iron will, and a touch of insanity are the perfect recipe for victory. Reavers live and die by this mantra, instilling their creatures with a cold and calculated anger that allows them to grow more powerful during battle while their foes tire out.\nAs a Reaver, your creatures will gain massive benefits in combat as battle continue to drag on. If your creatures manage to survive for just a few extra turns, they'll be able to devastate your enemies."
Pyromancer, PM,"Pyromancers quite literally thrive on watching the world burn. These maniacal magi ignite both friend and foe alike with a brilliant conflagration, causing their enemies to suffer gruesome deaths while empowering their allies with the power of flame.\nAs a Pyromancer, you'll make heavy use of the Burning debuff to deal damage to enemies over time. In addition, your own creatures will be afflicted with this debuff, but it will heal and empower them rather than dealing damage."
Necromancer, NM,"Necromancers prefer to overwhelm their foes by summoning minions to aid their creatures in battle. Enemies are often so perplexed by the number of undead monstrosities charging at them from across the battlefield that they're dead long before they realize what even happened.\nAs a Necromancer, you'll summon minions to aid your creatures in battle. These minions can do all kinds of things to support your creatures - they can cause damage, boost your creatures' stats, debuff enemies, and much more."
Defiler, DE,"The difference between good and evil is often a matter of perspective, but the morality of a Defiler is simple enough for anyone to decide.

Enemies will be so weak that your party will be able to easily pick them off, even if they were originally much more powerful than your creatures."
Animator, AN,"There's a fine line between genius and insanity, and it's difficult to say on what side of that line Animators reside.

Your entire battle strategy will likely focus on this creature. You can empower your Animatus, and even use your other creatures to make it stronger in combat."

To facilitate these effects, the Blood Mage offers a variety of different ways to inflict damage on his own creatures."

In addition, Inquisitors are able ot use healing effects for offensive purposes - for example, when your creatures heal enemies, they instead cause damage to them."

Generally, your enemies won't be able to act for the first few turns in battle as long as you're around."
Paladin, PA,"Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.

Each time your creatures take damage, they'll also damage their enemies."
Druid, DR,"Many people foolishly mistake a Druid's introversion for weakness. These magi believe that quality always trumps quantity on the battlefield. Contrary to tradition, they are often seen with fewer than six creatures at their disposal, but the havoc their limited numbers wreak when augmented by Druidic magic is a sight to behold.\nAs a Druid, you'll probably only want to have one (or up to three, later on) creatures in your party. Your creatures will gain massive benefits for being part of a smaller party."
Tribalist, TB,"Strength in numbers. Tribalists prefer to use creatures that belong to the same race or class, and take full advantage of the synergy and camaraderie they offer each other.\nAs a Tribalist, you'll want to assemble a party of creatures that belong to the same race. This will provide them with significant benefits that are exacerbated by their racial synergies with each other."

You'll also gain the ability to manipulate the element of luck - for example, if a positive effect has a chance to activate but fails to do so, you can try again."
